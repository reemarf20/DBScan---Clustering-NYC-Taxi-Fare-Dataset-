# DBScan---Clustering-NYC-Taxi-Fare-Dataset-

This repository contains the code for analyzing and predicting taxi fares in New York City. 
The project involves data cleansing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning clustering using Python and various libraries.

The goal of this project is to predict taxi fares in NYC by analyzing a dataset of taxi ride information. 
It involves various data processing and analysis techniques, including geospatial analysis and machine learning clustering.

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
    Python 3.x
    Pandas
    Geopandas
    Scikit-learn
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    Folium
    Haversine

Download the dataset (New York City Taxi Fare Prediction.csv) and place it in the root directory.
Open the Jupyter Notebook and try out the codes in the repository.
